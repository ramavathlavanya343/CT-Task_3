DESCRIPTION:A Lexical Analyzer (Lexer) is the first phase of a compiler, responsible for scanning the source code and converting it into tokens. Tokens are meaningful sequences like keywords, identifiers, operators, symbols, and constants. This project focuses on building a simple lexical analyzer in C language that reads a program from an input file and identifies three basic tokens: Keywords, Operators, and Identifiers.
